# Portfolio Jekyll Theme

Julia Romaniuk, London, UK. I've recieved PhD in 2012, specialisation linguistics (Germanic languages). In 2021 I became the co-owner of the UK-based software development company CornLogic specializing in providing businesses worldwide with custom technology solutions. Be it technology or project management, each client engagement provides unique opportunities to innovate and excel â€” to build next generation technology product or realize IT programs that change the ways of business for our clients.
As a dynamic and fast growing company, this excellence extends beyond technology roles, and is equally important to how we manage and sustain this rapid growth. The spirit of innovation and excellence is most evident in how we build and combine technology and people infrastructure or in what we do for our financial, marketing and quality practices.
